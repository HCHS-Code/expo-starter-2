# Expo Starter
This repo is a starting place to configure Codespaces when you are wanting to program mobile apps with Expo.

To get started...
1. Complete the first chapter of the tutorial on [Expo's Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/?authuser=0) (when you run your app, you will open it on the "web" option)
2. When you finish chapter one, you should commit your code, create a PR, and merge the PR into main.
3. Then you are ready to make another branch and start on your first feature.
